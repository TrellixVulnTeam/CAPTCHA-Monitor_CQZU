# Contributing

_First off, thanks for spending your time to contribute!_

This project was born from getting frustrated with CAPTCHAs while using the 
[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) and the ticket 
[#33010](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/33010) on Tor's trac 
ticketing system. 

## Ways to contribute
- Reporting bugs
- Pull requests
- Documentation
- Suggesting enhancements
- Developing new feature

## How does this thing work?
I would suggest taking a look at the 
[wiki page](https://gitlab.torproject.org/woswos/CAPTCHA-Monitor/-/wikis/home).
Please feel free to create an issue or reach me to ask questions.

## Developing new features
You can check the open issues to find suggestions made by others 
(most probably me at the moment) and try implementing those. If you have
a completely new feature to add, I would suggest creating an issue first to get
feedback.
